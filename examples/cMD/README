To run this example for analyzing cMD simulations with LPATH:

1. Cluster the conformations by running the get_clusters.py script (optional).
2. Run the run_lpath.sh script, which will first assign source/target states
   using the assign_states.py script. Note that if you did not cluster (step 1)
   you can adapt the assign_states.py script to assign not only source/target
   states but also all states in between source and target. If you assign all
   states in the discretize stage, you do not need to use the reassign functionality
   in the matching stage.

   Next, successful pathways connecting source and target will be extracted.
   In this example, the cluster IDs determined in step 1 (optional) are saved
   in the output.pickle file for use in the matching step.

   Finally, pathways are matched. The use of --condense 2 is generally always
   recommended. You only need to reassign states if you did not assign them
   directly through the discretize program (for instance, if clusters were
   determined through external means.

3. Once the run_lpath.sh script completes, you can enter the plots folder and
   visualize some of the results. You should already have seen the dendrogram
   pop up as part of the matching program, but if you want to generate a new
   dendrogram with a new threshold you can do so with the plot_dendrogram.py
   script. The other plotting scripts can be adapted to work with your system.
   The plot_network.py is the most complicated. Please familiarize yourself with
   networkx before attempting to edit it. Also realize that due to the periodic
   nature of alanine dipeptide's phi/psi angle coordinates, the network plot
   is more complicated than it would normally be.
