# Examples

This folder contains example jupyter notebooks and sample files on how to run the LPATH software.

To speed up the setup process, users may want to install the software using the `environment.yml` file 
located one directory level up. Some of the files in this `examples` folder are over >1 GB in size, 
which might require users to install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) to retrieve.
